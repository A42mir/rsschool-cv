## about me
Hello, I'm 28 and this is my first programming course. Before that I was working as a coach for 6 years. And for 2 years I'm a gym owner.
In my gym a lot off people working in IT and they are nice people. So when I decide to change my work and learn something new, I think IT is good
place if there a lot off good people.

I'm good at working with people. Sports teachs me discipline, working as a coach teachs me how to work with people, buisness teachs me how to make
right desicion. I know how to study, because I making it all my life. I think that I can master this course.
